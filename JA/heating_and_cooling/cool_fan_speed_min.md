Regular Fan Speed
====
### **Description**
Regular Fan Speed is the speed at which the fans on the toolhead will spin, unless the layer is very small. It applies to the layers whose printing time is not smaller than the Regular/Maximum Fan Speed Threshold.

### **Usage**
* A greater speed allows better cooling. This reduces oozing and stringing.
* A greater speed will produce better overhangs and reduces the pillowing effect.
* A lower speed will reduce warping with some materials and will make the print stronger.
* The fan speed should almost always be maximum when printing materials with a low glass transition temperature range, such as PLA.
