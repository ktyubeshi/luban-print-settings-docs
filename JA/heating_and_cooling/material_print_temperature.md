Printing Temperature
====
### **Description**
Printing Temperature is the temperature of the nozzle during printing.

The printing temperature affects how the material behaves during printing. A small difference in temperature can have a large effect on how the material flows. Increasing the temperature generally makes the material more fluid, so that the printer will extrude material faster.

Every type of filament has a range of temperatures it can be printed at. This will usually be listed on the box it came in and on the technical data sheet.

### **Influence**
If you set the parameter too large, the following situations may occur:
1. The material becomes harder to cool, which causes overhangs to sag more (requiring more support) and produces more stringing.
2. The material contracts more after being extruded, which may clog your nozzle and potentially damage your printer.

If you set the parameter too small, the feeder may grind on the material, making it stop extruding.

### **Usage**
When printing with large layer heights, wide lines, large flow, or great speeds, you are recommended to set a higher printing temperature.
