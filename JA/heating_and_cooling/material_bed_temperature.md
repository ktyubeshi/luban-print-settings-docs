Build Plate Temperature
====
### **Description**
For a printer that has a heated build plate, you can set Build Plate Temperature for it. Build Plate Temperature is the temperature of the heated bed during printing.

### **Influence**
Heating the build plate will keep the material slightly fluid and sticky. Some materials will form crystals upon freezing, and therefore shrink significantly upon freezing. The heated bed keeps the material just above the freezing temperature to prevent this shrinkage. Besides, the heated bed helps to maintain the stickiness of the liquid plastic, improving the adhesion of the print to the build plate.

However, if the build plate is kept too hot, the print will be very fluid where it touches the build plate. This causes the material to sag a bit, causing [elephant's foot](../troubleshooting/elephants_foot.md) on the bottom side of the print. Heating the build plate will also create a temperature difference between the material which is resting on the build plate, and the material higher up in the model, which causes [warping](../troubleshooting/warping.md) when the higher up material starts to shrink.
