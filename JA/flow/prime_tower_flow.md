Prime Tower Flow
====
### **Description**
Prime Tower Flow refers to the flow rate of the prime tower.

### **Influence**
* Increasing this setting enables more material being pushed in a smaller amount of space, which causes the nozzle to prime faster. This can save some time. 
* Increasing this setting too much can cause overextrusion. As a result there could be blobs on the prime tower which can cause the tower to be knocked over.
* This setting is taken into account when calculating how many perimeters the prime tower will have to prime enough volume for the [Prime Tower Minimum Volume](../dual/prime_tower_min_volume.md) setting, so increasing this setting will cause the prime tower to have fewer perimeters.
