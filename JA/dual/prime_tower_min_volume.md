Prime Tower Minimum Volume
====
### **Description**
Prime Tower Minimum Volume refers to the minimum amount of material the extruder must purge before switching back. 

When an extruder is on stand-by mode, a certain volume of material will have oozed out. The volume being primed as indicated by this setting is meant to compensate for the material lost.

This setting indicates the minimum amount of material that needs to be purged. The contours of the prime tower will be finished completely though, so more material may be purged.

You can set different values for each extruder, and the final tower may have different number of contours for each of the extruders.

### **Usage**
Setting the Prime Tower Minimum Volume too high is relatively harmless, but makes the printing time longer and wastes more material. The volume will be limited by the Prime Tower Size.
